Computer Graphics Engine
A C++ computer graphics engine capable of rendering 2D and 3D graphics using techniques like rasterization or ray tracing.

Features
Geometric transformations (rotation, translation, scaling)
Lighting models (ambient, diffuse, specular)
Texture mapping
Shading algorithms (Phong, Blinn-Phong, etc.)
Support for 2D and 3D graphics rendering
Getting Started
Building the Engine
To build the engine, you will need to have CMake installed on your system. Run the following commands in the terminal:


Verify
Edit
Copy code
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
This will generate a ComputerGraphicsEngine executable in the build directory.

Running the Engine
To run the engine, simply execute the ComputerGraphicsEngine executable:


Verify
Edit
Copy code
./ComputerGraphicsEngine
This will render a 3D scene using the default settings.

Customizing the Engine
You can customize the engine by modifying the main.cpp file to load your own 3D models, textures, and lighting settings.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to the engine, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
